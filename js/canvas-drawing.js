// Canvas Drawing Module - Main file
// This file loads all the canvas drawing sub-modules in the correct order

// The canvas drawing functionality has been split into three modules for better maintainability:
// 1. canvas-drawing-core.js - Core functions and coordinate calculations
// 2. canvas-drawing-patterns.js - Pattern drawing with half-drop support
// 3. canvas-drawing-sections.js - Section 1 and Section 2 drawing functions

// All functions are loaded into the global scope from the individual modules
console.log('üìê Canvas drawing module loaded - functions available globally');
